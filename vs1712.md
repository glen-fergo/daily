# What's new in Visual Studio 17.12

## Display method return values

The Visual Studio debugger now displays inline values for return statements, responding to one of the most requested features from the developer community.

This enhancement allows you to see the exact values being returned by functions directly in the code, eliminating the need for additional code or temporary variables to inspect return values.

With GitHub Copilot, you can take it further by using the Ask Copilot option on hover to analyze return values directly in Visual Studio, allowing you to address issues immediately.

It is supported in both native and managed code.

## Copy from the Error List

You see an error in the Error List that you don't know how to fix. So, you select it and hit Ctrl+C to copy the description for a web search. After you've pasted it into the search engine, you realize it copied all column headers and row values instead of just the description. Now you must delete everything except the error description before you can perform the web search. This is cumbersome, but now we have a fix!

When you copy an error from the Error List using Ctrl+C, only the description is copied to the clipboard. This makes it easier to search for the error online or share it with others.

You can still copy the entire row by right-clicking the error and selecting **Copy Row** from the context menu or hitting Ctrl+Shift+C.

If what you wanted to do with the error description was to do a web search, then just hit _Ctrl+F1_ to search for information about the error online.


## AI smart variable inspection

Inspecting and analyzing values from Locals, Autos, and DataTips has never been easier with Ask GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio. Simply right-click on any value to get detailed AI-driven insights on errors, unexpected outcomes, or anomalies - all without ever leaving your IDE.

This feature will significantly enhance your troubleshooting speed by analyzing variables in real-time within your IDE whenever unexpected values arise.
